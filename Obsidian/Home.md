## How to navigate
- Use the search bar in Obsidian for quick lookup (commands, ports, service names).
- Repo pages live in `Obsidian/Repos/` and focus on human-friendly summaries.
- Each page favors short sections and copy-ready commands.

## Windows access
- Open Obsidian and choose **Open folder as vault**.
- If this repo is in WSL, the typical Windows path is:
  - `\\wsl$\\<YourDistro>\\home\\patrick\\projects\\Obsidian`
- If the repo is on a Linux-only host, sync or copy `Obsidian/` to a Windows-accessible folder, then open that folder as a vault.
