# Doc Update Checklist

Practical checklist for creating or updating pages in this vault.

## When to use this
- Adding a new repo page in `Repos/`
- Updating workflows, commands, or ports
- Changing architecture or deployment details

## Checklist
- Confirm the audience and goal in the opening paragraph.
- Add a **Quick Start** section with the smallest working path.
- List **Ports** (or state none) so users know what opens locally.
- Include **Key Scripts** for common workflows.
- Cross-link related pages with `[[Wiki Links]]`.
- Verify commands run from the intended directory.
- Keep secrets out of examples; use placeholders for tokens.
- If behavior changed, mention it near the top of the page.
- Update `Repository Index` if a repo name or purpose changed.

## Optional extras
- Add a Mermaid diagram when data flow is important.
- Note prerequisites (Docker, Node, CLI tools) if required.
- Add troubleshooting items for known pitfalls.
